STE Template Engine
===================

The STE Template Engine (STE) is a template engine for the PHP programming
language.

Requirements
------------

PHP >= 5.3

Why should you use it?
----------------------

* It's syntax (inspired by Textpattern's template syntax) is very easy and
  similar to the syntax of (X)HTML. So it should be easy for designers to learn
  this system.
* It has a simple, yet powerful plugin interface. You can easily define your
  own template functions / tags. It is even possible to write them in the
  template language itself, which makes it kind of a programming language...
* It can transcompile templates into PHP.
* You can use anonymous functions to define custom tags.

Documentation
-------------

The `docu` directory contains the documentation of the template language.
If you need the documentation of the php code / the API, you can create it with the `mkdocu.sh` script.
You will need [NaturalDocs](http://www.naturaldocs.org/) for that.

There is also a mirror of the documentation [here](http://r7r.kch42.net/ste_docu/).
